    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All Purpose Flour – some have used a combination of whole wheat flour and all purpose flour with great success</li>
        <li>Sugar</li> 
        <li>Baking Powder – this is what helps give the waffles their perfect rise!</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter – you can use salted or unsalted</li>
        <li>Milk – I use either 2% or whole milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat waffle iron.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Warm the milk up in the microwave for just 1 minute, or heat until slightly warm on the stove top.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl whisk the eggs and stir in the warm milk, melted butter and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until blended.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter into the preheated waffle iron and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp. Serve immediately or lay on a cooling rack until cool. Store in zip close bags in freezer.</li>
    </ol>
